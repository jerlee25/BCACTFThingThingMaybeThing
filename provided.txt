Description:
 
Here is an image. Image will help you find flag. Flag good. Got it? Great.



Hints (in some order):

1. Perhaps there is information in the image that isn't in the image?????? Whaaaaaaat?


2. Letters? OMG I love letters! So much so that I might base off an entire puzzle off of it!


3. But which letters? Perhaps ones of pertinence to the club we are in? Maybe I already gave you some letters?


4. What would you do with these letters? Think outside


5. and like, get some fresh air. Because that's good. But also maybe use some information that you haven't used yet.


6. Or maybe you have. I won't judge. I too need to improve my handwriting.


7. Ever heard of a route cipher? If not, there's this thing called Google that might help.
	
		     _
8. Do you ever just |   instead of /? I do, because it's easier.


9. Other than that, follow the directions! And fills in the Xs.


10. If you've gotten this far, I bet you're pretty annoyed at me. Fair.


11. If you need more help at this point, just ask. The puzzle is pretty dumb.


12. If you've gotten farther but can't find the flag, I have to say it's not just the puzzle that can be described as such.


13. jk. But like, it's really not that bad. I hope.


14. Maybe I'm the dumb one. I probably am y'know.


15. This wasn't even that great of a puzzle.


16. I should be studying right now, but I'm not.


17. Better go do that now.


18. All questions and concerns shall be directed to the person sitting to my left.


19. See you in Canada!
