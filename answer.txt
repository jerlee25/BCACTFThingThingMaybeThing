Sorry about that. But here's a somewhat reasonable explanation for a completely unreasonable puzzle.

You should have been given an image. 
If you opened said image, you would have noticed it was a worksheet for children to practice handwriting.
Incredible. Wow.
Anyhow, if you opened said image in a text editor, you'd notice something at the bottom!

This!

Have fun!



Notice the statement in parenthesis.
This is an indicator that what you are about to witness is complete nonsense, and I don't like people right now.

There are letters above and below said statement. 
Above, there are 6 letters.
Below, there are 6 groups of letters.
Belower, there are 6 lines with ?s and Xs.
Belowest, you have a tinyurl link with a bunch of Xs, and a statement telling you to have fun.
Feel free to ignore this statement, as it is asking the impossible of you.

But back to the 6s. 
666 is a number often associated with scary things and whatnot.
That, however, is not pertinent to this problem.
What is pertinent is the fact that each letter can be connected to a group of letters and a mysterious line.

Take, the first set of what shall be henceforth be referred to as "pineapples"

Here, we have 

pin - B
eap - 

BUUVF 
RNYYL 
AGTRG 
VSSRE 
AGURY

ples - XXXXX??????????????

What do we do with this? 
Well, when life gives you pineapples, make pineappleade!

At the bottom, notice that the link contains a bunch of Xs.
Perhaps if you knew what filled those Xs, you would know where to go next! WOW!

How do we take the stuff from the first pineapples and make it into something useable.
Well, the image is of letters. So why don't we ask the image?

Hey image, how do you write the letter B, which is our pin?

XXXXX
X___X
XXXXX
X___X
XXXXX

Thanks image!
That hardly looks like a B, but I'm tired and can't see the difference.
And the image kindly tells you what order to create the B in! 
Lets use what the image tells us to decode our eap!

BUUVF 
RNYYL 
AGTRG 
VSSRE 
AGURY

becomes

BUUVF 
R___L 
AGTRG 
V___E 
AGURY

which becomes

BRAVAUUVFLGRTGEYRUG!

Now comparing that to the ples..

BRAVAUUVFLGRTGEYRUG
XXXXX??????????????

...you can see that your first 5 Xs are BRAVA!

Now all you have to do is repeat this process 5 more times!
How fun! 

If you follow this pattern to exactly how I envisioned it in my head, you should get:

VZRIYBYNRCLBHYV


HCLGAEVMMBRVGGFU


GRYCRYHEBNYYTBN


RHUAONFVJ


BLXUNHYQEVA

for the next 5 letters!

A was a bit weird, because letters don't go all tilted like that. 
So just imagine A to be more like a square with two legs.

And once you plug all of the eaps into the pless, you get

BRAVALBHYVGFUYHEBNRHUAOBLXUN

And putting that into the url, you get sent to an amazing google doc with the flag!

Wasn't that fun!

Again, any questions, comments, or concerns shall be directed towards the person directly to my left.
